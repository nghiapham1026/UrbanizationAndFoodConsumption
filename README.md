# Urbanization and Food Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the effects of urban population growth on dietary intake in South Asia using data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). By examining the relationship between urbanization and various dietary metrics, the project aims to shed light on how shifts towards urban living are influencing food consumption patterns, nutritional quality, and health outcomes in the region.

## Objectives
- To assess the impact of urbanization on dietary energy requirements, protein supply, fat supply, and the prevalence of undernutrition and obesity.
- To model the trends and projections of urban population growth and its influence on dietary consumption and nutritional status.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes datasets from FAO. The data is filtered to focus primarily on South Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Key datasets include:
- **Population Data**: Urban and total population figures.
- **Dietary Data**: Indicators of food availability, consumption, and nutritional status, such as average dietary energy requirement, number of people undernourished, prevalence of obesity among adults, protein supply, and the share of dietary energy derived from cereals, roots, and tubers.

## Analysis
The project utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for an extensive analysis that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and trend projection. Specific areas of investigation comprise:
- **Population and Dietary Models**: Modeling changes over time in urban population and its percentage, alongside dietary indicators.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying regression models to explore the relationships between urbanization levels and dietary variables.
- **Trend and Projection Models**: Forecasting future trends in urbanization and its potential impact on food consumption and nutritional outcomes.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining correlations between urban population growth and various dietary indicators to identify significant patterns.
