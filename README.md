# Urbanization and Food Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the intricate relationship between urbanization and food consumption patterns, focusing on South Asia. Utilizing various datasets, we analyze trends in urban population growth alongside changes in food security indicators, such as dietary energy consumption, protein supply, and the prevalence of undernourishment. Our goal is to uncover insights into how urbanization impacts food consumption and nutritional outcomes.

## Datasets
The analysis is based on processed and raw data, including:
- Food Security Data: Indicators of food availability, consumption, and nutritional quality.
- Population Data: Urban and total population figures.

Data sources are meticulously processed to ensure relevance and accuracy, focusing on South Asia but also including East Asia for a comprehensive view.

## Analysis
The project comprises an extensive analysis conducted through Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts for data processing, and models for correlation, regression, and trend analysis. Key areas of investigation include:
- Correlation between urbanization and various food security indicators.
- Regression models to predict food consumption patterns based on urbanization levels.
- Trend analysis to forecast future changes in urbanization and food consumption.
